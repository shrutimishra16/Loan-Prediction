        <h2>What is a Loan?</h2>
        <div class=" fin_content ">
            <p>The term loan refers to a type of credit vehicle in which a sum of money is lent to another party in exchange for future repayment of the value or <span class="decorate">principal</span> amount. In many cases, the lender also adds interest
                or finance charges to the principal value which the borrower must repay in addition to the principal balance.
            </p>
            <p>Loans may be for a specific, one-time amount, or they may be available as an <span class="decorate">open-ended line of credit</span> up to a specified limit. Loans come in many different forms including secured, unsecured, commercial, and
                personal loans.<span id="bb"></span> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A loan is when money is given to another party in exchange for repayment of the loan principal amount plus interest. </li>
                <li> A loan may be secured by collateral such as a mortgage or it may be unsecured such as a credit card. </li>
                <li>Lenders will consider a prospective borrower's income, credit score, and debt levels before deciding to offer them a loan.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="cc">Why are loans used?</h2>
        <div class=" fin_content ">Loans are advanced for a number of reasons including major purchases, investing, renovations, debt consolidation, and business ventures. Loans also help <span class="decorate">existing
                companies expand their operations.</span> Loans allow for growth in the overall <span class="decorate">
                money supply</span> in an economy and open up competition by lending to new businesses. The interest and fees from loans are a primary source of revenue for many banks, as well as some retailers through the use of
            <span class="decorate">credit facilities</span>and credit cards.
        </div>

        <h2>The Loan process</h2>
        <div class=" fin_content ">
            <p>Here's how the loan process works. When someone needs money, they apply for a loan from a bank, corporation, government, or other entity. The borrower may be required to provide specific details such as the reason for the loan, their financial
                history, <span class="decorate">Social Security Number (SSN)</span> , and other information. The lender reviews the information including a person's <span class="decorate">debt-to-income</span> (DTI) ratio to see if the loan can be paid
                back.
            </p>
            <p> Based on the applicant's <span class="decorate">creditworthiness</span>, the lender either denies or approves the application. The lender must provide a reason should the loan application be denied. If the application is approved, both parties
                sign a contract that outlines the details of the agreement. The lender advances the proceeds of the loan, after which the borrower <span id="dd"></span> must repay the amount including any additional charges such as interest.
            </p>
            <p>The terms of a loan are agreed to by each party before any money or property changes hands or is
                <span class="decorate">disbursed</span>. If the lender requires collateral, the lender outlines this in the loan documents. Most loans also have provisions regarding the maximum amount of interest, as well as other
                <span class="decorate">covenants</span> such as the length of time before repayment is required.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Relationship b/w interests and loan</h2>
        <div class=" fin_content "><span class="decorate">Interest rates</span> have a significant effect on loans and the ultimate cost to the borrower. Loans with higher interest rates have higher monthly payments—or take longer to pay off—than loans with lower interest rates.
            For example, if a person borrows $5,000 on a five-year installment or term loan with a 4.5% interest rate, they face a monthly payment of $93.22 for the following five years. In contrast, if the interest rate is 9%, the payments climb to $103.79.
            <span id="ee"></span> Higher interest rates come with higher monthly payments, meaning they take longer to pay off than loans with lower rates.
            <p>Similarly, if a person owes $10,000 on a credit card with a 6% interest rate and they pay $200 each month, it will take them 58 months, or nearly five years, to pay off the<span class="decorate">
                    balance</span>. With a 20% interest rate, the same balance, and the same $200 monthly payments, it will take 108 months, or nine years, to pay off the card. </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Types Of Loan</h2>
        <div class=" fin_content ">Loans come in many different forms. There are a number of factors that can differentiate the costs associated with them along with their contractual terms.
            <h3> Secured vs. Unsecured Loan</h3>
            <p>Loans can be <span class="decorate">secured</span> or <span class="decorate">unsecured</span>. Mortgages and car loans are secured loans, as they are both backed or secured by collateral. In these cases, the collateral is the<span class="decorate"> asset</span>for
                which the loan is taken out, so the collateral for a mortgage is the home, while the vehicle secures a car loan. Borrowers may be required to put up other forms of collateral for other types of secured loans if required.
            </p>
            <p>Credit cards and <span class="decorate">signature loans</span> are unsecured loans. This means they are not backed by any collateral. Unsecured loans usually have higher interest rates than secured loans because the risk of default is higher
                than secured loans. That's because the lender of a secured loan can repossess the collateral if the borrower
                <span class="decorate"> defaults</span>. Rates tend to vary wildly on unsecured loans depending on multiple factors including the borrower's credit history.
            </p> <span id="ff"></span>

            <h3>Revolving vs. Term Loan </h3>
            <p>Loans can also be described as <span class="decorate">revolving </span>or<span class="decorate">term.</span> A revolving loan can be spent, repaid, and spent again, while a term loan refers to a loan paid off in equal monthly installments
                over a set period. A credit card is an unsecured, revolving loan, while a <span class="decorate">home
                    equity line of credit </span>(HELOC) is a secured, revolving loan. In contrast, a car loan is a secured, term loan, and a signature loan is an unsecured, term loan.
            </p>

        <h2>Tips on getting loans</h2>
        <div class="fin_content">In order to qualify for a loan, prospective borrowers need to show that they have the ability and financial discipline to repay the lender. There are several factors that lenders consider when deciding if a particular borrower is worth the risk:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Income :</b> </li> For larger loans, lenders may require a certain income threshold, thereby ensuring that the borrower will have no trouble making payments. They may also require several years of stable employment, especially in the
                case of home mortgages.
                <li><b> Credit Score:</b></li> A credit score is a numerical representation of a person's creditworthiness, based on their history of borrowing and repayment. Missed payments and bankruptcies can cause serious damage to a person's credit score.
                <li><b> Debt-to-Income Ratio:</b></li> In addition to one's income, lenders also check the borrower's credit history to check how many active loans they have at the same time. A high level of debt indicates that the borrower may have difficulty
                repaying their debts.
            </ul>In order to increase the chance of qualifying for a loan, it is important to demonstrate that you can use debt responsibly. Pay off your loans and credit cards promptly, and avoid assuming any<span id="prediction"></span> unnecessary
            debt. This will also qualify you for lower interest rates. It is still possible to qualify for loans if you have a lot of debt or a poor credit score, but these will likely come with a higher interest rate. Since these loans are much more
            expensive in the long run, you are much better off trying to improve your credit scores and debt-income ratio.
